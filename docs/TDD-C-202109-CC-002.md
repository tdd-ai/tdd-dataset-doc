Turkish Twitter dataset for Offensive Speech Identification in Social Media. 

The original dataset of [OffensEval2020](https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/results-and-paper-submission) is presented in five languages. We share only the Turkish subset. 

## Dataset Curation

This dataset was collected from Twitter, where the tweets are annotated for offensive speech with _offensive_ or _non-offensive_ labels (Çöltekin, 2020).

There is no validation split provided in the [original source](https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/results-and-paper-submission) of this dataset. Hence, we create our own split from the original training split. 

## Annotation Quality

For details on the annotation guidelines and inter-annotator agreement rates see the original paper [Çöltekin, 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.758.pdf).

## Dataset Format

We share the dataset using `.jsonlines` format with UTF-8 encoding. 

```
{ "text" : "buralara değil yaz günü, kışın bile kar yağmıyor", "label" : "not-offensive" }
```
