PosTagged and Lemmatized nGrams extracted from TS Wikipedia Corpus. This dataset consists 12.101.939 nGrams harvested from [TS Wikipedia Corpus](https://tscorpus.com/corpora/ts-wikipedia-corpus/). 

## Dataset Details

The data set is consisted of 9 tab separated columns respectively presents the first word of nGram, its part of speech annotation, the lemma for the first word, the second word, its part of speech annotation, the lemma of the second word, the observed frequency of nGram, the frequency of the first word and the frequency of the second word in the whole data set. Given frequencies are calculated case-sensitively
